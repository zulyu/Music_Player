## Project Description 
### Project Background Information
This project was developed as a final project for Chapman University's CPSC 231 (Computer Science 2) course to highlight object-oriented programming in Java (inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction). This project allows multiple users to create an account to add songs, playlists, podcasts, and albums.

### Project Collaboration Details
This project was completed over the course of 2 weeks in the Spring of 2023 in a course at Chapman University, CPSC 231 (Computer Science 2), which is a course focused on teaching students about the fundamentals of coding in Java and OOP.

One other colleague and I developed the code and worked extensively on this project to demonstrate our learned knowledge throughout the course. Although we all collaborated on the project together, all of the code we each wrote was entirely our own.

## Technologies 
This project was coded in Java using Visual Studio Code.
